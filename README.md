# .dotfiles

## Introduction

This is the way I choose to organise the .dotfiles on my development machine and install my software development arsenals.  It is largely personal but the guiding principles was influenced by the work of [holman](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles).  I was motivated to do this because I cannot find my head around OMZ - if you know what I mean.

## Installation

 > Clone the repo into your home folder and execute ./.dotfiles/bin/systeminstaller.sh - make sure you understand the content of systeminstaller.sh before executing the shell script.

## Outstanding task list
