# .dotfiles

## Introduction

This is the way I choose to organise the .dotfiles on my development machine and install my software development arsenals.  It is largely personal but I was influenced and motivated to do this because I cannot find my way around OMZ - if you know what I mean.

## Installation

 > Clone the repo into your home folder and execute ./.dotfiles/bin/systeminstaller.sh - make sure you understand the content of systeminstaller.sh before executing the shell script.

## Resulting shell prompt
